# Altschool-final-project
This capstone project aims to design and implement a robust data pipeline using various technologies and tools. The goal is to extract data from a chosen API (from sources like https://apilist.fun/ or any other suitable dataset accessible via API), transform it, and load it into a structured data warehouse for further analysis and reporting.
